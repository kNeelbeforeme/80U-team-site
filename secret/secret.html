<h1>Secret Area Located!!!</h1>
<p>
	Congrats! You found the secret area, coded in so that <b>you</b> could find it! whether you found it by searching through the files on github or just by luck, you found this page! on this page, I will show you something astonishing! it is called HTML, or <mark>Hyper Text Markup Language</mark>. This language is the programming language used to code this website. it is a simple language with simple syntax that you can learn too. like, if i wanted to, i could put a link to a video of another vex team <a href="https://youtu.be/8j7caZii-hI">just like this.</a> oh, and feel free to click that link, as it does work. And if i want to, i could put a link <a href="https://kneelbeforeme.github.io/80U-team-site/">to the homepage here </a> as well. See? HTML is amazing!
